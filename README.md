# Internship Test ml-test-vision-nlp

## Overview
This repository contains solutions for two test tasks designed to evaluate skills in Data Science, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and NLP. The tasks aim to demonstrate practical applications of AI models in real-world scenarios.

## Repository Structure
This repository consists of two main folders, each containing a separate test task:
- **`Image_Classification/`** – Contains Task 1: Image Classification + OOP.
- **`NER_ImageClassification/`** – Contains Task 2: Named Entity Recognition + Image Classification.

Each task has its own folder with:
- A dedicated **README file** explaining the solution and setup instructions.
- A **requirements.txt** file listing all dependencies.
- Python scripts for training, inference, and evaluation.
- A **Jupyter Notebook** demonstrating the model’s functionality with examples and edge cases.

For detailed information about each task, refer to the README files inside the corresponding task folders:
- [Task 1: Image Classification + OOP] - Image_Classification/README.md  
- [Task 2: Named Entity Recognition + Image Classification] - NER_ImageClassification/README.md
